![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-pre--release-orange)

`pySigma` is a python library that parses and converts Sigma rules into queries. It is a replacement
for the legacy Sigma toolchain (sigmac) with a much cleaner design and is almost fully tested.
Backends for support of conversion into query languages and processing pipelines for transforming
rule for log data models are separated into dedicated projects to keep pySigma itself slim and
vendor-agnostic. See the *Related Projects* section below to get an overview.

## Getting Started

To start using `pySigma`, install it using your python package manager of choice. Examples:

```
pip install pysigma
pipenv install pysigma
poetry add pysigma
```

Documentation with some usage examples can be found [here](https://sigmahq-pysigma.readthedocs.io/).

## Create Your Own Backend for pySigma

The creation of a backend has become much easier with pySigma. We recommend using the "Cookie Cutter Template" and reviewing the existing backends listed in the "Related Projects" section of this README.

## Features

`pySigma` brings a number of additional features compared to `sigmac`, as well as some changes.

### Modifier comparison between pySigma and sigmac

|Modifier|Use|sigmac legacy|
|--------|---|:-------------:|
|contains|the value is matched anywhere in the field (strings and regular expressions)|X|
|startswith|The value is expected at the beginning of the field's content (strings and regular expressions)|X|
|endswith|The value is expected at the end of the field's content (strings and regular expressions)|X|
|base64|The value is encoded with Base64|X|
|base64offset|If a value might appear somewhere in a base64-encoded value the representation might change depending on the position in the overall value|X|
|wide|transforms value to UTF16-LE encoding|X|
|re|value is handled as regular expression by backends|X|
|cidr|value is handled as an IPv4 CIDR by backends (IPv6 is not supported, yet)||
|all|This modifier changes OR logic to AND|X|
|lt|Field is less than the value||
|lte|Field is less or egal than the value||
|gt|Field is Greater than the value||
|gte|Field is Greater or egal than the value||
|expand|Modifier for expansion of placeholders in values. It replaces placeholder strings (%something%)||

More details are described in [the documentation](https://sigmahq-pysigma.readthedocs.io/).

## Testing

pySigma uses pytest as testing framework. Simply run `pytest` to run all tests. Run `pytest
--cov=sigma` to get a coverage report.

## Building

To build your own package run `poetry build`.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please feel free to lodge any issues/PRs as discussion points.

This [blog post](https://medium.com/@micahbabinski/creating-a-sigma-backend-for-fun-and-no-profit-ed16d20da142) by Micah Babinski explains the process from a developer's perspective. 

## Maintainers

The project is currently maintained by:

- Thomas Patzke <thomas@patzke.org>
- [frack113](https://github.com/frack113)

## Related Projects

pySigma isn't a monolithic library attempting to support everything but the core. Support for target
query languages and log data models is provided by additional packages that extend pySigma:

* [sigma-cli](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-cli): a command line interface for conversion of
  Sigma rules based on pySigma.
* [pySigma-backend-splunk](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma-backend-splunk)
* [pySigma-pipeline-sysmon](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma-pipeline-sysmon)
* [pySigma-pipeline-crowdstrike](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma-pipeline-crowdstrike)

All packages can also be installed from PyPI if not mentioned otherwise by the Python package
manager of your choice.
