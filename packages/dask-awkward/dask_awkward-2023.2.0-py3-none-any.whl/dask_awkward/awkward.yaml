awkward:

  # This option causes graph creation to fail if the metadata of a
  # dask-awkward Array collection cannot be determined.
  raise-failed-meta: False

  # This option is for cases where new array collections are created
  # with unknown metadata. The default setting is to compute the first
  # partition of the collection so that we can define the metadata. If
  # this option is set to False then collections with unknown metadata
  # will be instantiated with the `_meta` attribute set to an "empty"
  # typetracer, which is an empty awkward array.
  compute-unknown-meta: True

  # column-projection-optimization currently has 3 possible values
  #
  # - "brute-force": a brute force search for columns that are
  #   required for the task graph to complete without raising an
  #   IndexError (each column is held out and the metadata task graph
  #   is computed as a requirement test)
  #
  # - "simple-getitem": checks for calls to getitem in the task graph.
  #   This optimization is determined faster than the brute-force
  #   method, but it may not be as complete w.r.t. eliminating
  #   unncessary reads.
  #
  # - "chained": use both methods together
  #    Currently not implemented (but planned)
  #
  # - null, false, or "none": To turn off the optimization
  #
  column-projection-optimization: "simple-getitem"
