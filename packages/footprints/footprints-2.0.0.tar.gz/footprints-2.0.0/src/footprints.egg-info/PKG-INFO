*footprints* is a generic multi-purpose fabric for objects with tunable
footprints, i.e. some set of key/value pairs that attributes (possibly
optional) could cover.

Originally, it has been developed as part of the *Vortex* project. Recently
the  code has been extracted from the *Vortex* code base. It is now presented
as an independent Python package.
