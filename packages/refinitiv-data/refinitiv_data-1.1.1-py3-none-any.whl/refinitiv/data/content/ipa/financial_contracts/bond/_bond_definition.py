    Parameters
    ----------
    instrument_tag : str, optional

        characters are supported. Optional.
    instrument_code : str, optional
        Code to define the bond instrument. It can be an ISIN, a RIC, a CUSIP or an
        AssetId .
    end_date : str, optional
        Maturity date of the bond to override. Mandatory if instrument code has not been
