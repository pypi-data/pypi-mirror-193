# sphinx-multiversion [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Holzhaus/sphinx-multiversion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Holzhaus/sphinx-multiversion)

Sphinx extension for building self-hosted versioned docs.

This extension aims to provide a clean implementation that tries to avoid
messing with Sphinx internals as much as possible.
