# DREEM Aggregate Module
Contributor: Yves Martin

## Purpose
The bitvectors are turned into a json file that will contain the key information for the bitvector, plus additional information such as per-sample content, per-reference content, RNAstructure prediction.

- If library.csv is an input, splits the reads into sections
- If clustering.json is an input, splits the reads into clusters
- Aggregates the bitvector by counting for each reference
  - number of mutations per residue across reads
  - histogram of number of mutations per read
  - base coverages per residue across reads
  - insertions per residue across reads
  - deletions per residue across reads
  - ...
- Adds the content of `samples.csv`.
- Adds the content of `library.csv`.
- Adds RNAstructure prediction.

## Interface
