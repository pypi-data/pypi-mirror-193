# Basic Calculator Package

## This package was made as a project for Turing College course

## After installation, import it as: from calculator.calculator import Calculator
### Description:

This calculator is made as a class named Calculator.

There are 7 different Calculator class methods available.

5 of them are operations methods, 2 of them are memory methods.

Operations methods: *(These methods take up to two arguments)*

                    .add(x,y) - Adds two numbers, x+y
                    .substract(x,y) - Substracts two numbers, x-y
                    .multiply(x,y) - Multiplies two numbers, x*y
                    .divide(x,y) - Divides two numbers, x/y. Y cannot be assigned a value of zero.
                    .nr(y,x) - Returns y-th root of x, example: .nr(2,4) 2nd root of 4 = 2 (square root in          this case)

Memory methods:
                *(Memory methods dont take any arguments)*
                .show_memory() - shows current memory value
                .clear_memory() - resets memory to value of 0
