Citing Afterburner Software
===========================

If you utilise Afterburner software as part of your research or production work,
we'd be grateful if you could include an appropriate citation.

If you need to refer to Afterburner software in a generic manner within, say, a
research paper or article, then the suggested citation format is as follows::

  Afterburner software, (C) British Crown Copyright 2016-2017, Met Office
  URL: https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/afterburner/

If you need to refer to a particular Afterburner release, e.g. for software audit
trail and/or reproducibility purposes, then the suggested citation format is as
shown below::

  Afterburner v1.0.0, 09-May-2017, (C) British Crown Copyright 2016-2017, Met Office
  URL: https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/afterburner/turbofan/tags/v1.0.0

In the latter case the release label, release date, and repository URL should be
changed to reflect the version of Afterburner being used.
