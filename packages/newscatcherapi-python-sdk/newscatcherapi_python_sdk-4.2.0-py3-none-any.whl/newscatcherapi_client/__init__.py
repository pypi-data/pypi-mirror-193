In other words, we're like Google for the news part of the web, which you can access as a source of data.  Some useful links: - [How NewsCatcher Works](https://docs.newscatcherapi.com/knowledge-base/how-newscatcher-works) - [GitHub for the Python SDK](https://github.com/NewscatcherAPI/newscatcherapi-sdk-python)   # noqa: E501
