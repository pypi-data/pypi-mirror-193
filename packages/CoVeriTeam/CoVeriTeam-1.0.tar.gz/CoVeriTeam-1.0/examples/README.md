# Tutorial
This folder contains a few example compositions that can
be executed on test inputs using the script [./run_examples.sh](run_examples.sh).

**The examples can be executed individually by copying the command-lines from [run_examples.sh](run_examples.sh).**

## Validating Verifier
The CoVeriTeam program [validating-verifier.cvt](validating-verifier.cvt)
runs `UAutomizer` as a verifier on an example C program taken from the `sv-benchmarks` collection and
a reachability specification.
Then it runs `CPAchecker` as a validator using the verification witness produced by the verifier.

## Execution-Based Validation
Execution-based validation is an approach to result validation based on a violaion witness for a
reachability specification.
First, it transforms the given violation witness to a test case and then
executes the C program on the extracted test case to see if an `error` state is reached.
The file [execution-based-validation.cvt](execution-based-validation.cvt) contains
the CoVeriTeam program as discussed in the [literature](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1).

Following code snippet is taken from the file [execution-based-validation.cvt](execution-based-validation.cvt):
```code
w2test = ActorFactory.create(WitnessToTest, "../actors/cpachecker-witness-to-test.yml", "default");
testval = ActorFactory.create(TestValidator, "../actors/test-val.yml", "default");
spec_to_testspec = SpecToTestSpec();
execution_based_validator = SEQUENCE(PARALLEL(w2test, spec_to_testspec), testval);
```

We first extract a test case from a violation witness and then executes it to check whether
the specification is violated.
The validator is a sequential composition of two actors: a *witness-to-test converter*
(`Program`  &#215; `Specification` &#215; `Witness` &#8594; `TestSuite`,
and a test validator (`Program`  &#215; `Specification` &#215; `TestSuite` &#8594;  `Verdict`).
It uses *SpecToTestSpec*, a utility actor, to transform the safety
specification for verification to a test specification consumed by test validator.


## Reducer-Based Construction of a Conditional Model Checker
Conditional model checkers produce and consume conditions in additon to consuming only programs and specifications,
and producing only verdict and witness. [Reducers](https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3180259) can
be used to construct a conditonal model checker from an existing model checker, thus saving implementation effort.
A program reducer removes those paths
that were successfully verified already from the input program.
This residual program can then be given
to an off-the-shelf model checker for verification
that does not support input conditions.
The CoVeriTeam program [cmc-reducer.cvt](cmc-reducer.cvt) constructs and executes a
reducer-based conditional model checker.
Following code snippet is taken from this file:

```code
verifier = ActorFactory.create(ProgramVerifier, "../actors/uautomizer.yml", "default");
reducer = ActorFactory.create(CMCReducer, "../actors/cmc-reducer.yml", "default");
cmc = SEQUENCE(reducer, verifier);
```

This sequence of a program reducer and a model checker constructs
a conditional model checker.

## Parallel Portfolio execution
We provide several example CoVeriTeam programs of the parallel portfolio for different use cases:
- [portfolio.cvt](portfolio.cvt) Standard portfolio with four verifiers: CPAChecker, Symbiotic, UAutomizer, ESBMC.<br>
Success condition is adjusted for verifiers (result must have a key verdict with value true of false)
- [validating-portfolio.cvt](validating-portfolio.cvt) Combination of verifier and validator. Uses CPAChecker and ESBMC
as Verifiers and CPAChecker as Validator.<br> Each result of a verifier is checked with the validator in if they are 
the same, the portfolio stops and returns this result.
- [portfolio-tester.cvt](portfolio-tester.cvt) Portfolio of the testers FuseBMC and Symbiotic. As success condition a
result must have a non-empty test suite.
