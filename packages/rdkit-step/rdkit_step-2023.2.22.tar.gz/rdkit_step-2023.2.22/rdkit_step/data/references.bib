This is an initial library of BibTex references for the rdkit_step plug-in for SEAMM,
generated automatically by the cookiecutter. You may wish to edit the first entry to correct some
of the information.

Add other references to the end of the file and add code in the plug-in to cite the references as
appropriate. This is done with code like this:

        self.references.cite(
            raw=self._bibliography['doi:10.1002/jcc.21224'],
            alias='packmol',
            module='packmol_step',
            level=1,
            note='The principle PACKMOL citation.'
        )

which is typically in the run() method of the plug-in.

The base node class in SEAMM automatically reads this list of references into a dictionary in
self._bibliography with the key being the key of the BibTex entry -- usually the name on the
first line of the entry after the 'article' or 'misc' (for software) keyword.

See the documentation for the Reference Handler for the other arguments to cite().

abstract = {A method is presented for the rapid calculation of atomic charges in σ-bonded and nonconjugated π-systems. Atoms are characterized by their orbital electronegativities. In the calculation only the connectivities of the atoms are considered. Thus only the topology of a molecule is of importance. Through an iterative procedure partial equalization of orbital electronegativity is obtained. Excellent correlations of the atomic charges with core electron binding energies and with acidity constants are observed. This establishes their value in predicting experimental data.}

These descriptors are based on atomic contributions to van der Waals surface area, log P (octanol/water), molar refractivity, and partial charge. The descriptors are applied to the construction of QSAR/QSPR models for boiling point, vapor pressure, free energy of solvation in water, solubility in water, thrombin/trypsin/factor Xa activity, blood-brain barrier permeability, and compound classification. The wide applicability of these descriptors suggests uses in QSAR/QSPR, combinatorial library design, and molecular diversity work.}
