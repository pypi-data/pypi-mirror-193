Data is collected in part with the use of a Selenium webdriver. Web pages will be periodically opened and closed in order to webscrape information; please do not close these pages -- they will be automatically closed when the code has been executed. Thank you :)

NOTE: Jsong version 0.8 takes significantly longer to process full discographies, but is more user-friendly. For a quicker process, please download Jsong version 0.7.
