# WingmanGPT

## Overview
WingmanGPT is a command-line tool that allows you to send text messages that are customly modified by ChatGPT and sent to a specified number. 

### Notice
`This tool currently only works for Mac users.`

## Install

1. Clone the repository and `cd` to it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/btschwartz12/WingmanGPT.git
$ cd /your/path/to/WingmanGPT
$ pwd
/your/path/to/WingmanGPT
```

2. Run the `install.sh` script, using the `source` command, activating the virtual environment
```bash
$ source install.sh
...
Successfully installed WingmanGPT-1.0.0
...
$ echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
/your/path/to/WingmanGPT/env
```

3. Verify the package exists in the envirnoment
```bash
$ which WingmanGPT
/your/path/to/WingmanGPT/env/bin/WingmanGPT
```

4. Get your API token from [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session), and initialize it for the tool. *Make sure you are signed in before doing this. You can get your token by accessing the linked url and copying the value for the 'accessToken' key.*

```bash
$ WingmanGPT make-token [token] # Don't actually put the brackets, just the token 
$ cat token
...
your token
...
```
5. **Optional**: make a template message file. This allows you to not have to provide a message as a command-line option.

```bash
$ WingmanGPT make-message "My custom message"
$ cat message.txt
...
your message
...
```




## Usage

Please note that when running the program, you will get a warning from your Mac asking you if it can send a message. You must click OK for the tool to work.

REQUIRED:
(-n, --number) [NUMBER]:

## ChatGPT Functionality

This tool makes use of the [revChatGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT) open-source project to communicate with ChatGPT. Go check it out!

Everything that is used for the prompt, as well as the different modes, can be found in [src/prompts.py](src/prompts.py). 

To see all of the availible modes from the command line, you can run:

```bash
$ WingmanGPT show-modes
```
