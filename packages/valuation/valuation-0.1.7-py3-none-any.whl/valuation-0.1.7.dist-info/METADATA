# DaaValuationEngine
[Repository](https://github.com/Deloitte-Audit-Analytics/DaaValuationEngine)

[Project](https://github.com/Deloitte-Audit-Analytics/DaaValuationEngine/projects/2)

[Releases](https://github.com/Deloitte-Audit-Analytics/DaaValuationEngine/releases)
## Setting up the project for development in PyCharm (on Windows)

### Prerequisites:
* `BeyondCompare` installed
* `PyCharm Community` installed
* `Python >= 3.9` installed
* `git` installed

### Setting up the development environment and working with PyCharm
1) Clone the repository into `C:\Users\<user_name>\<your choice>`, then in `<your choice>` right click `DaaValuationEngine` -> `Open Folder as PyCharm Community Edition Project`
2) Setting up a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/). This can be done in PyCharm:
    * `File -> Settings -> Project: DaaValuationEngine -> Python Interpreter -> Small gear in the upper right -> Add -> Virtualenv Environment`
    * Make sure that the Python installation is correctly mentioned under `Base interpreter` -> click `OK`, the virtual environment will be created in `DaaValuationEngine\venv`.
3) Setting up PyCharm Terminal

    The PyCharm `Terminal` works with both PowerShell and `cmd.exe`. The option to switch between the two is under:  
    `File -> Settings -> Tools -> Terminal -> Shell path` (requires Terminal restart by closing the `Local` terminal window and reopening `Terminal`)
    <br />  
    If `cmd.exe` is used and the `venv` is activated, the `Terminal` will look like this

    ```
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19042.1766]
    (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
    
    (venv) C:\Users\sbohlen\GitHubProjects\_2022_DaaValuationEngine\DaaValuationEngine>
    ```
    If the `(venv)` is missing, it is not activated, in this case check `File -> Settings -> Tools -> Terminal -> Activate virtualenv` (requires Terminal restart).  
    It is recommended to use `cmd.exe`. However, if PowerShell is used (default in newer PyCharm versions), the terminal should look like this
    ```
    Windows PowerShell
    Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

    Try the new cross-platform PowerShell https://aka.ms/pscore6

    PS C:\Users\sbohlen\GitHubProjects\_2022_DaaValuationEngine\DaaValuationEngine>
    ```
    In this case you can run
    ```
    python
    import os
    import sys
    os.path.dirname(sys.executable)
    ```
    to check if the venv is activated.
4) Installing dependencies of the library
    ```
    (venv) C:\Users\sbohlen\GitHubProjects\_2022_DaaValuationEngine\DaaValuationEngine>cd src
    (venv) C:\Users\sbohlen\GitHubProjects\_2022_DaaValuationEngine\DaaValuationEngine\src>py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5) Marking `src` as sources root (so that PyCharm recognizes the import structure of the library)  
`DaaValuationEngine\src -> Right click -> Mark Directory as -> Sources Root`
6) BeyondCompare   
    If BeyondCompare is installed in `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\Beyond Compare 4\BCompare.exe`, this part can be skipped. Otherwise:
    * Create an empty python file `user.py` in `C:\Users\<user_name>`
    * Add your version of the following line:
    ```
    COMPARISON_COMMAND = r'C:\Users\sbohlen\AppData\Local\Beyond Compare 4\BCompare.exe'
    ```
7) Test the setup  
`DaaValuationEngine\test\RegressionTest\run_regression_fast.py -> Right click -> Run 'run_regression_fast'`  
The tests should run and a file comparison should be opened after the run by BeyondCompare.  
Sometimes BeyondCompare will mark files as not equal (red) even though there are no visible differences. In this case:
    * [Optional] Rerun the test so that BeyondCompare is open
    * `Session -> Session Settings -> Comparison -> Requires opening files ->` check `Compare contents` and `Binary comparison`
    * Change `Use for this view only` to `Also update session defaults`

8) [Optional] Integrate GitHub with PyCharm  
The local PyCharm project can be configured to be linked to the GitHub [Project](https://github.com/Deloitte-Audit-Analytics/DaaValuationEngine/projects/2)
This can be done in `Tools -> Tasks & Contexts -> Configure Servers...`.  
This is e.g. useful for creating feature branches associated directly to GitHub issues. After the server configuration, this can be done in `Tools -> Tasks & Contexts -> Open Task`.


## Project Structure

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy either with the 
gcloud CLI or locally. It includes the following files and folders.


```
.
+-- src                         -> SOURCE ROOT
|   +-- consts                  -> Constants, type definitions, field definitions
|   +-- inputs                  -> General data input handling
|   +-- universal_transfer      -> Handles the transformation from raw inputs to internal storage objects
|   +-- engine                  -> QuantLib environment and functions
|   +-- universal_output        -> Handles the general output provisioning
|   +-- olmypia                 -> wraps the process around in- and outputs and provides an compatible interface
|   ... several helper modules
|   main.py                     -> External entry points (Provides the entpoints for an API)
|   run_valuation.py            -> Internal entry points
|   ... 
|
+-- docs                            -> Supporting literature and screenshots
+-- test                            -> Unit-, regression-, and library tests for the application code.   
|   +-- InitialTests                -> Tests that are performed initially (Proof of concept)
|   +-- InterfaceTest               -> Tests all external interfaces (excel, market data connection, etc.)
|   +-- LibraryTest                 -> Tests the financial-mathematical correctness of the library
|   +-- RegressionTest              -> General Regression
|   +-- unit                        -> Single unit tests
|   ...
...
```

The version is globally defined in the first init.

## Build the sample application

Everytime the application is pushed to the master, the following steps are automatically applied:

    1. Creates a new version tag
    2. Releases the code under that version tag
    3. Adds the __version__ to the __init__.py
    4. Builds the application with python -m build (preferences in setup.cfg)
    5. Adds the built assets to the release

This procedure is controlled by [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions)

### Version Tags

Semantic version tags are used, consisting of v```major```.```minor```.```patch``` (e.g. v1.0.0). By default, when 
pushing on the master, the ```minor``` is increased to create the new version tag. Include ```#major``` or ```#patch```
to the commit message to increase the others instead.

**_NOTE:_** The version will always be increased by the highest of ```#major```, ```#minor```, and ```#patch``` contained
in all commit messages in a given push to the master. If none of the commits contains a flag, the ```minor``` 
is increased.

For further documentation see: [anothrNick/github-tag-action](https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action)

## Install the application

Download the wheel (```.whl```) of any version from the [release page](https://github.com/Deloitte-Audit-Analytics/DaaValuationEngine/releases).
The current version is always flagged with a ```latest``` label. Then execute:

```bash
pip install --target <INSTALLATION PATH> <WHEEL PATH>
```
## Deploying the cloud functions and the main service 

To deploy the cloud functions make sure you are in the same directory of the `app.yaml` folder and run the following commands

```bash
Write-Output "Deploying functions"
gcloud functions deploy get_schedule --runtime python39 --region europe-west3 --entry-point get_schedule --trigger-http
gcloud functions deploy roll_date --runtime python39 --region europe-west3 --entry-point date_roller --trigger-http
gcloud functions deploy get_calendars --runtime python39 --region europe-west3 --entry-point get_calendars --trigger-http
```

To deploy the main service function, you need to first set the project id using the following command
```bash
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```
and after setting the ```PROJECT_ID``` make sure to do the appropriate changes in the following folders
```app-engine-main```,```olympia.config.ini``` and ```local.config.ini``` where you should replace the project ID in the url and references.

after setting all these up, you can now deploy the function with the command

```bash
gcloud app deploy
```
