  Fermilab Tevatron. Measurement of the differential cross sections for charged current neutrino and antineutrino interactions on iron, and the determination of the structure functions F2 and xF3 using a one-parameter fit to the inelasticity Y distributions. The data were collected during 1996-97 using separate high-purity neutrino and antineutrino beams with energies from 30 to 500 GeV.. This part (1) contains the F2 and xF3 distributions corrected to an isoscalar (iron) target. Parts 2 and 3 contain the differential cross sections themselves for neutrino an antineutrino beams respectively.. Numerical values of F2 and xF3 supplied by M. Tzanov.
