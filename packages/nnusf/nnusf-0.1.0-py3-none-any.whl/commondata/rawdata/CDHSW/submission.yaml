  CERN-SPS. Upgrade CDHS detector. CDHSW Collaboration. Data on differential cross sections and nucleon structure functions in charged current neutrino interactions on iron using CERN wide bound neutrino beam 0.19 & lt;= Q**2 & lt;= 196.3 GeV**2. 0.0 & lt; X & lt; 0.7. Data obtained from 640,000 neutrino events and 550000 anti-neutrino events. Normalization of each bin is to the energy independent values SIG/E = 0.703 * 10**-38 (0.331 * 10**38) CM**2/GeV per nucleon for neutrinos (anti-neutrinos), as given in ZP C35 (87) 443. Target is iron. Data are corrected for radiative effects but not for Fermi Motion. This record and Part 2 contain the differential cross sections. Part 3 contains the structure functions F2 and XF3. Part 4 contains the structure functions FW and & lt;a& gt; used to determine F1 and F2 for any given value of R.
