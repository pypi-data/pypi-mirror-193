# Hi there!

<font size="3"> Over the past years, deep-learning-based tools have
become increasingly popular and abundant, particularly in the image
processing domain. In fact, even the image shown next to this text was
created by such a tool - with nothing but a few keywords as input (go
checkout <a href="https://starryai.com/">starryai</a>). Similarly,
deep-learning-based image analysis tools also have a growing impact on
biomedical research. However, such deep-learning-powered scientific
software tools are rarely as user-friendly as starryai (or
<a href="http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut">DeepLabCut</a>,
to name at least one positive exception). And make no mistake, also
<i>findmycells</i> will not be able to make such a giant leap forward.
Instead, it was developed to narrow the gap by bringing state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based bioimage analysis tools to users with little or even
no coding experience. This is achieved, as it integrates them in a full
end-to-end bioimage analysis pipeline that comes with an intuitive and
interactive graphical user interface that runs directly in Jupyter
Notebooks. But enough introduction - please feel free to test it
yourself! Either follow the installation instructions below, or head
over for instance to the

# Installation guide

*findmycells* is currently only available via pip:

> pip install findmycells

**Note:** Please be aware that *findmycells* was so far only tested in a
Linux subsystem run under Windows (Ubuntu 20.04.5 in WSL2 on both
Windows 10 and Windows 11). In addition, having a GPU is highly
recommended when using
[deepflash2](https://github.com/matjesg/deepflash2) or
[cellpose](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose) for the segmentation
of your images.

# For developers

This package is developed using [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/)
