## Status

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-alpha-orange)](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx)

HadroDB is in alpha. Alpha means different things to different people, to us, being alpha means:

- Interfaces may be significantly changed
- The data file format is unstable
- Key functionality is missing
- Bugs probably exist which make this system unsuitable for any business use
