# netifaces (2)

## 1. What is this?

The original [netifaces](https://github.com/al45tair/netifaces) was abandonned by it's maintainer,
leaving us without the option to get network addresses of any kind in Python. Unfortunately, the
original sources are more akin to arcane magic, so picking where it's been left off is a difficult
task.

I decided to rewrite `netifaces`, keeping the **almost** exact same API and adding the following:

- Support for future python versions
- Type annotations
- Maybe a more "queriable" API in the future

This project aims to be a drop-in replacement for those project who use `netifaces`, but I do not
guarantee anything.


### 1.1 What is not working **right-now**

- The `gateways` API is only working if your system has a `/proc/net/route` file
- The `windows` API is non-functional

The following section is taken from the origin netifaces:

## 2. Usage

For now the API is the same as the original `netifaces`, so please refer to [it](https://github.com/al45tair/netifaces).

Install:
```shell
pip install netifaces2
```

Import:
```python
>>> import netifaces
>>> netifaces.interfaces()  
    ...
>>> netifaces.ifaddresses('en0')
    ...
>>> netifacs.gateways()
    ...
```

## 3. API differences between this and al45tair/netifaces

### `gateways`

The `gateways` function does not support indexing through the `default` special key. This is because it makes a
sane typing definition difficult to write and be understandable. Instead, if you want the same functionality,
the following is exposed:

```python
>>> netifaces.default_gateway()
    ...
```

The result will be the default gateway for each interface type. The result may be an empty dict if no default
route is set.

### `AF_` Constants

In the previous version of `netifaces` the `AF_` constants' value were assigned
to be platform independent. This has the nice effect of abstracting the OS when
accessing the information of a network layer. However after consideration, it
does not feel like the right place to provide abstraction. If you update your
project's dependencies to this version of `netifaces`, be wary of this change.
For instance, on linux you may need to replace `AF_LINK` with `AF_PACKET` to get
mac addresses.

In the future, an extra API will allow accessing a specific layer's information
by querying for it, without using the platform's constant.

## 4. Platform support
