Supports submitting single listens, now playing notifications and import of
multiple listens. Automatically honors the ListenBrainz server's rate limits.

```python
import time
from listenbrainz_submit import ListenBrainzClient, Track


# The user's personal ListenBrainz token obtained from https://listenbrainz.org/profile/
user_token = "..."
client = ListenBrainzClient(user_token=user_token)

# Prepare a track to submit
track = Track(
    artist_name="Dool",
    track_name="Vantablack",
    release_name="Here Now, There Then",
    additional_info={
        "listening_from": "My great music player",
        "recording_mbid": "e225fb84-dc9a-419e-adcd-9890f59ec432",
        "release_mbid": "aa1ea1ac-7ec4-4542-a494-105afbfe547d",
        "artist_mbids": "24412926-c7bd-48e8-afad-8a285b42e131",
        "tracknumber": 1,
    }
)

# Inform ListenBrainz that this track is playing right now. ListenBrainz
# will display this track on the user's listens page as being currently played.
client.playing_now(track)
```

To actually submit a track as has been listened to call:

```python
# Submit the listen with a current timestamp
client.listen(int(time.time()), track)
```
