## Inspiration
Nor Pydantic, FastAPI, Ruff, ... seem to use `Poetry` to manage dependencies. In fact, since Poetry's last update to `v1.20` I have encounter quite a few problems running different project. Another huge issue is that `Poetry` does not respect the [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) standard which may cause issue when the project interacts with libraries that expect an standard format for the `pyproject.toml` file.

This Template Project does not require any Package Manager, it runs purely with native Python solutions (`.venv`, for example) and sticks with `requirements.txt` files to manage dependencies (Which, btw, is the pythonic way to handle this).

## How to run?
- Create a virtual environment
- Activate the environment
- run `make install env=dev`
