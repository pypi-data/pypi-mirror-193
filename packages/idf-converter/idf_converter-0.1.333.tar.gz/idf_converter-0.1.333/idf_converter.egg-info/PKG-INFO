IDF converter is a set of Python tools to convert satellite, in-situ and
numerical model data into Intermediary Data Format, i.e. self-contained,
CF-compliant NetCDF files that are easier to analyse than the original files.

The IDF files produced by the converter can also be visualised using SEAScope,
a viewer which offers advanced rendering functionalities that ease the
detection of synergies between several sources of observations and simulations
(available on Linux, Windows and macOS).

For more information about the Intermediate Data Format (IDF), please read the
`IDF specifications document`_

You can download SEAScope and some examples of IDF files on the
`SEAScope website`_.

Changelog
=========

0.1.333 (2023-02-20)
--------------------

* Sentinel-3 SRAL L2 reader failed to convert 20Hz data because the brightness
  temperature variables are only available at 1Hz. The reader has been adapted
  to skip these variables when converting 20Hz data.

* The underflow workaround in the downscaling process would only work if all
  values were positive due to a typo, it has been fixed.

0.1.330 (2023-02-10)
--------------------
* Support added for brightness temperature variables in the Sentinel-3 SRAL L2
  reader.

* Reader for Sentinel-3 OLCI L2 Chlorophyll-a data did not interpret flags
  correctly for data generated after February 2021 (baseline 003), it has been
  adapted to support these data too.

* The transform method for computing an anomaly based on a climatology file has
  a new "interpolate" boolean option: when set to False the converter will
  consider that the climatology file is defined on the same grid as the file to
  convert (interpolating the climatology file is costly in terms of memory, so
  performing this interpolation once as a pre-processing step can save a lot of
  resources when converting many files with the same grid, images from
  geostationnary satellites for example).

* Compression options were only applied to the full resolution IDF, the
  converter now also applies them to the downscaled IDFs.

* Minimal version for the netCDF4 dependency set to 1.6.0 and above (required
  for propagating compression options).

* Bugfix for underflow errors that may arise in the downscaling process.

0.1.312 (2022-10-06)
--------------------

* Readers for Sentinel-1 L2 data have been modified to include the name of the
  L2 SAFE as a global attribute (named L2_SAFE) in the output IDF file. This
  only applies when the input file was located in a directory layout matching
  the SAFE specifications.

0.1.309 (2022-10-03)
--------------------

* Readers for Sentinel-1 L2 data have been modified to avoid naming conflicts
  for granules from the same datatake and inaccurate temporal coverage for
  files generated with versions of the Instrument Processing Facility (IPF)
  below 3.40.

0.1.308 (2022-09-09)
--------------------

* Initial version
