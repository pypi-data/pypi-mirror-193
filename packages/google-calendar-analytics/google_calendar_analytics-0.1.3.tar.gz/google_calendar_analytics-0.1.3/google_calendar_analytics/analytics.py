class AnalyzerFacade:
    """
    Facade class for analyzing calendar events and generating charts.
    The class provides two methods for analyzing events: 'analyze_one' and 'analyze_many'.
    It uses a CalendarDataCollector to retrieve events from Google Calendar API and a DataTransformer
    to transform the data into the format required by the plotting functions. The plotting is done by
    creating instances of ManyEventPlot and OneEventPlot from the PlotFactory.

        data_collector (CalendarDataCollector): An instance of the CalendarDataCollector class.
