# The purpose of this file is to config SSH in WSL2 so that it is accessible from LAN.
# before running this script, WSL2 can only be SSHed from the same machine, given WSL2 address.
# after running this setup, user from within windows must run wsl_server.ps1 to activate port forwarding.
# the most common pitfall here is sshd fails to start as evidenced by `sudo service ssh status` because the sshd_config file is not readable or has wrong line endings or wrong configuration.
# Thus, you see that it works when installed, but after modifying sshd_config it fails. Try different port never used before.
