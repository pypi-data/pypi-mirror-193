### Features
#### Codegen (introspection compiler)
- [x] object types, for each field there is a corresponding `Property`
- [x] enums
- [x] custom scalars
- [x] query handlers
#### Runtime
- [x] "Qt-native" graphql-transport-ws network manager (supports subscriptions).
#### Helpers
- [x] generic models that get created from dictionaries (with update, pop, insert implemented by default)
- [x] `Property` classes that are accessible from QML, with dataclasses  syntax (using attrs)
- [x] `@slot` - decorator to be replaced with `QtCore.Slot()` that get types from type hints.

### Future vision
- Code generation from schema inspection
Ideally every graphql type would be a `QObject` with `Property` for each field.
- possibly generate C++ bindings from schema inspection
- Query only what defined by the user (similar to how relay does this)
- Auto mutations
- Subscriptions

### "Just build a web based UI"
Qt-QML IMO is a big game changer
- you get native performance
- UI code is very clear and declarative
- Easy to customize
- Easy to learn

One of the big disadvantages in Qt-QML is that Qt-C++ API is very repetitive and hard to maintain
for data-driven applications.

although it is tempting to just use `relay` or other `JS` graphql lib
there is a point where you would suffer from performance issues (react-native).
