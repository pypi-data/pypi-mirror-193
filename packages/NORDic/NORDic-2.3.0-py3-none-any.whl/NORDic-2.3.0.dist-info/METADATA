# Network Oriented Repurposing of Drugs (NORDic)
(c) Clémence Réda, 2023.

[NORDic](https://github.com/clreda/NORDic) is an open-source package which allows to focus on a network-oriented approach to identify regulatory mechanisms linked to a disease, master regulators, and to simulate drug effects on a network, and adaptively test drugs to perform drug repurposing. As such, it is comprised of four distinct parts:
- **NORDic NI** identifies a disease-associated gene regulatory network (as a *Boolean network*) with its dynamics from several biological sources.
- **NORDic PMR** detects master regulators in a Boolean network.
- **NORDic DS** (since version 2.0.0) scores the effect of a treatment on a patient (the higher the score, the most promising the treatment) based on a Boolean network.
- **NORDic DR** (since version 2.0.0) uses the routine in **NORDic DS** and a bandit algorithm to adaptively test treatments and perform drug repurposing.

## Note about using functions from UTILS/utils_sim.py

You will need to install MaBoSS 
```bash
conda install -c colomoto -y -q maboss
```
