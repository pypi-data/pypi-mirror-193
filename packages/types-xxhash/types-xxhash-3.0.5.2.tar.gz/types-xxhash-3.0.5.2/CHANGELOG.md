Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.

## 2.0.5 (2022-04-29)

Delete python 2 branches from third-party stubs (#7741)

Since #7703, we no longer have third-party stubs that support Python 2, so code like `if sys.version_info >= (3, 0)` can be simplified.

## 2.0.2 (2021-10-12)

## 2.0.1 (2021-09-14)

Update the `xxhash` and `hashlib` stubs (#6031)

* `name`, `block_size`, `digest_size` and `digestsize` attributes of hash objects were made read-only.
* It is now a type-checking error to subclass `xxhash` classes, such as `xxhash.xxh32`. Previously it was an error only at runtime.
* `xxhash` functions now accept strings as input and any object with `__index__()` method for `seed` (instead of requiring an integer). They also fail the type checking if no arguments are given.
