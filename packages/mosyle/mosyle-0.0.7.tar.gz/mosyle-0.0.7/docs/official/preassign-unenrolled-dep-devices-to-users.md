# Can I use the “Assign Devices” operation to pre-assign unenrolled DEP devices to users?

At this time, the API does not support pre-assignment. Instead, you may pre-assign unenrolled devices associated with your ASM account to users through the Manual Assignment spreadsheet.

To do so, go to My School > Users > Device Assignment > Spreadsheet Assignment > Download CSV.

Complete the template and upload to Mosyle. Once the file is uploaded, any unenrolled devices assigned to Mosyle from ASM will be pre-assigned to the user specified.
