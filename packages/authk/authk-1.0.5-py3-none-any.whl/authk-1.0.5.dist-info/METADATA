# AuthK

[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-100%25-green.svg)](https://github.com/BstLabs/py-authk/blob/d0e772deb5de5dfae4002b0cee605b783d0cd467/README.md)

AuthK is a lightweight Python library to handle ssh keys within authorized_keys file directly from CLI.

It's built on top of [DynaCLI](https://pypi.org/project/dynacli/) and [sshpubkeys](https://pypi.org/project/sshpubkeys/).
That makes it user friendly and secure.

AuthK was developed by [BST LABS](https://github.com/BstLabs/) as an open source generic infrastructure foundation for the cloud version of Python run-time within the scope of the [Cloud AI Operating System (CAIOS)](http://caios.io) project.

For details about the AuthK rationale and source code, refer to [AuthK](https://github.com/BstLabs/py-authk/) Github repository.
