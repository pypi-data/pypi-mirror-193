------------

Begin by cloning the Git repository

    git clone git@github.com:makerplane/pyAvTools.git

or

::

    git clone https://github.com/makerplane/pyAvTools.git 


If you'd like to install the program permanently to your system or into a virtualenv you
can issue the command...

::

  sudo pip3 install .

from the root directory of the source repository.  **Caution** This feature is still
in development and may not work consistently.

Development
-----------

To set up your development environment, you can create a virtualenv:

::

  make venv

Then, you can install all required dependencies:

::

  make init

Afterwards, you are ready to develop. Once one or more dependencies have changed, simply run
`make init` again.

Distribution
------------

To create a Python wheel for distribution, run:

::

  make wheel

The wheel will be then created in the `dist/` directory.
