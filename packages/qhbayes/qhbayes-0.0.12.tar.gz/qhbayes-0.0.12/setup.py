The eruption column height is linked to the mass eruption rate through the fluid dynamics of turbulent buoyant plumes, but there are often external volcanological and atmospheric effects that contribute and complicate the relationship.\n\nDatasets of the mass eruption rate and eruption column height have been compiled and used to determine an empirical relationship these quantities, using linear regression.  This has then been used to infer the mass eruption rate from the plume height.\n\n*QHBayes* goes further, by using Bayesian methods to perform the regression.  Bayesian methods:\n* allow us to incorporate a range of *uncertainties* quantitatively into our model;\n* provide a meaningful quantitative comparison of different models;\n\n### Main Features ###\n\n\n### How do I get set up? ###\n\n* Summary of set up\n\n\n* Configuration\n* Dependencies\n* Database configuration\n* How to run tests\n* Deployment instructions\n\n### Contribution guidelines ###\n\n* Writing tests\n* Code review\n* Other guidelines\n\n### Who do I talk to? ###\n\n* Repo owner or admin\n* Other community or team contact\n',
