pyfolio is a Python library for performance and risk analysis of
financial portfolios developed by Quantopian Inc.Â It works well with the
Zipline open source backtesting library.

At the core of pyfolio is a so-called tear sheet that consists of
various individual plots that provide a comprehensive performance
overview of a portfolio.

This package is designed to fix the error - AttributeError:
'numpy.int64' object has no attribute 'to_pydatetime'

Solution: - find def get_max_drawdown_underwater(underwater) - 'change
line valley = underwater.index\[np.argmin(underwater)\] \#
np.argmin(underwater)'
