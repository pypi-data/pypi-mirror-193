lokan(result == 5, lambda: werili(result))




Functions: 


werili: #takes any number of arguments and concatenates them into a string separated by sep. The resulting string is then printed to the console followed by end.

dekhel: #prompts the user for input and returns the user's response as a string.

lokan:# takes a boolean condition and a function result_fn. If condition is True, the function result_fn is called and its result is returned. Otherwise, None is returned.

ilokan: #similar to lokan, but returns a default value instead of None if the condition is false.

tsema: #returns a default value for use in ilokan.

akesam: #splits a string into a list of items based on a separator.

akelab: #returns a reversed list of items.
