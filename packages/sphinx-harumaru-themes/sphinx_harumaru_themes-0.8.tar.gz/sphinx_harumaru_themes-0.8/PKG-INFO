"Harumaru" Sphinx Documentation Themes
======================================

This is a collection of themes for use with Sphinx documentation projects.
These themes are based on my [Harubootstrap]<https://github.com/DanielSDVG/harubootstrap>
library.

Installation
------------

Installation from PyPI is fairly straightforward:

1. Install the package::

      $ pip install sphinx_harumaru_themes

2. Edit the ``conf.py`` configuration file to point to the theme::

      html_theme = 'haruki_light'

Available themes are as follows:

*  ``haruki_light``

   .. image:: img/preview_haruki_light.*

*  ``haruki_hw``

   .. image:: img/preview_haruki_hw.*

*  ``haruki_dark``

   .. image:: img/preview_haruki_dark.*

*  ``daimaru_light``

   .. image:: img/preview_daimaru_light.*

*  ``daimaru_hw``

   .. image:: img/preview_daimaru_hw.*

*  ``daimaru_dark``

   .. image:: img/preview_daimaru_dark.*

*  ``erika_hw``

   .. image:: img/preview_erika_hw.*

Note: these previews use the "Modern Love" font for titles. Its license does not allow it to be used in ``@font-face`` rules,
but including that font in your CSS font stack (``font-family``) is allowed.
