# Pynkowski

A Python package to compute Minkowski Functionals of input fields, as well as their expected values in the case of Gaussian isotropic fields.

The formats supported for **input data** are the following:
- Scalar HEALPix maps, as the ones used by [healpy](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/) (see paper).

...and more to come, feel free to contact us (by [email](mailto:javier.carron@roma2.infn.it) or opening an issue) to implement more schemes.


The **theoretical expectation** for Gaussian isotropic fields are implemented in the following cases:
- Gaussian scalar maps on the sphere (such as CMB $T$, see paper).
- $\chi^2$ maps on the sphere (such as CMB $P^2$, see paper).

...and more to come, feel free to contact us (by [email](mailto:javier.carron@roma2.infn.it) or opening an issue) to implement more theoretical expectations.
