# hashequal
a Python tool for quasi-interactive math sheets, aiming to provide Mathcad-like experience  
on execution it modifies the calling script annotating the results of the operations marked with #= 

## example

before running

~~~python
#! /usr/bin/env python

import hashequal

a = 1 + 1 #=
b = a * 2 #=  # comment
~~~

after running

~~~python
#! /usr/bin/env python

import hashequal  # run 2018-11-06 18:59:54 UTC

a = 1 + 1 #= 2
b = a * 2 #= 4  # comment
~~~

## instructions

- `import hashequal` at the beginning of the file, eventually just below the interpreter directive
- mark every operation whose result is to be annotated with an `#=` comment
- if there need to be further comments on an `#=` line, use another following `#`

## known issues

- does not handle implicit line continuations
