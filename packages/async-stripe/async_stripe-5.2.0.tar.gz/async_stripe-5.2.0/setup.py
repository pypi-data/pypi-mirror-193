Hence, the performance is much\nbetter than other wrapper libraries which use threading.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall requires Python 3.6 or newer.\n\n```sh\n$ pip install async-stripe\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe usage api is similar to Stripe's official library:\n\n```python\nfrom async_stripe import stripe\n\nstripe.api_key = '<stripe-secret-key>'\n\npayment_intent = await stripe.PaymentIntent.create(amount=1000, currency='usd')\n\nprint(payment_intent.id)\n```\n\n---\n\n**/!\\ Note:** Since this library monkey-patches the actual `stripe` library, \nyou should avoid using the two in the same process.\n\nOnce you import `async_stripe`, the official `stripe` library gets patched with \nasync methods and the original synchronous api won't be available.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nPlease see [`stripe-python`'s README][5] file for configuring logging and other things.\n\n#### Unsupported configurations:\n\n`async-stripe` aims to be a drop-in async replacement for `stripe`. However, \nthere are a few things which are not yet supported:\n\n - Custom http client: Currently, it's not possible to configure a \n custom http client and Tornado's [`AsyncHTTPClient`][1] will be used by default.\n - Proxy: Connecting to api via a proxy is not supported yet.\n\n## Development and Testing\n\nWhen adding new features and monkey-patches, please add relevant tests and \nensure that all the tests also pass. \n\nIn most cases, you shouldn't need to write the tests yourself: you can just \ncopy-paste the tests form the original stripe library and change the synchronous \nmethods to asynchronous methods. \n\nFor testing, first, [install and run the `stripe-mock` api server][2].\n\nNext, install `pytest`, `pytest-mock` and `pytest-asyncio` python packages in \nyour virtualenv.\n\nFinally, run the tests like this:\n\n```sh\n$ pytest tests\n\n# or run a specific test\n$ pytest tests/api_resources/test_customer.py\n$ pytest tests/api_resources/test_customer.py::TestCustomer\n```\n\n## License\n\nA lot of the code (especially tests) are copied with slight modifications from \nStripe's official library. That code is licensed under \n[MIT License][3].\n\nRest of the original code is licensed under [BSD-3-Clause License][4].\n\n\n[1]: https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/httpclient.html#tornado.httpclient.AsyncHTTPClient\n[2]: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mock\n[3]: LICENSE.stripe.txt\n[4]: LICENSE.txt\n[5]: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/blob/master/README.md",
