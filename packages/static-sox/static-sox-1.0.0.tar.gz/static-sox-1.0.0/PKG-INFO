# About

Installs sox binaries and allows you to use them in your python code.

# Without this library...

Your sox tool would have to rely on the user to install sox, with the right build settings to ensure your tool functions correctly. This is a major pain for sox based tools (missing codecs for example) and this library solves this problem.

As of now, binaries are available for:

# Development

To develop software, run `. ./activate.sh`

# Windows

This environment requires you to use `git-bash`.

# Linting

Run `./lint.sh` to find linting errors using `pylint`, `flake8` and `mypy`.

# Release

  * 1.0.0: Initial release. All builds pass.
