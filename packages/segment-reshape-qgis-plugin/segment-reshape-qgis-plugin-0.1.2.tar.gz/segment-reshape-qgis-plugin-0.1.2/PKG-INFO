# segment-reshape-qgis-plugin

QGIS plugin with a map tool to reshape a continuous segment topogically.

## Plugin

`Segment reshape tool` plugin is available from the QGIS plugin repository. It provides a simple toolbar with one action. Action will activate a segment reshape map tool, with which a common segment portion can be clicked and a new segment can be digitized. After digitizing the features are edited to match the new common segment.

## Library

To use this library as an external dependency in your plugin or other Python code, install it using `pip install segment-reshape-qgis-plugin` and use imports from the provided `segment_reshape` package. If used in a plugin, library must be installed in the runtime QGIS environment or use [qgis-plugin-dev-tools] to bundle your plugin with runtime dependencies included.

### API documentation

Simple use case can be seen in [integration test](./test/integration/test_simple_line_reshape.py).

#### Finding common segment

`segment_reshape.topology.find_related.find_segment_to_reshape` calculates the line segment between features that share equal sequence of vertices along their edges at the trigger location. By default all QGIS project layers are used to find connected features if topological editing is enabled. Custom list of layers can also be passed as an argument.

Return values are:

- Common segment (`None` if not found)
- Features that share the common segment (and relevant vertex indices)
- Features that share the end points of the common segment (and relevant vertex index)

#### Editing geometries partially

`segment_reshape.geometry.reshape.make_reshape_edits` reshapes the provided common parts and edges, so that common part shared vertex indices are replaced and edges are moved to match the reshaped geometry. Output of `find_segment_to_reshape` (common parts & edges) can be used as input for this function.

#### Map tool

Map tool is found in `segment_reshape.map_tool.segment_reshape_tool.SegmentReshapeTool`, it can be subclassed or used as is in custom plugins.

# CHANGELOG

## [0.1.2] - 2023-02-23

- Feat: Set z coordinate values of the reshaped geometry to QGIS's default z coordinate value instead of NaN

## [0.1.1] - 2023-01-17

- Fix: Correcly move multiple edges for same feature

## [0.1.0] - 2022-12-14

- Feat: Add support for key commands (backspace and esc) in vertex editing
- Fix: In cases where segment was split from the middle the start and end parts of the line is correctly merged back together.
- Fix: Geometry comparison was fixed so that only common vertices between geometries are taken into account. Before edges were split if an edge crossed other edge also from non vertex point.
- Feat: Preserve source feature z coordinate for calculated segment

## [0.0.3] - 2022-11-17

- Fix: Fix missing toolbar icon by including resource files in setuptools build

## [0.0.2] - 2022-11-09

- Feat: Implement a QGIS plugin with a simple toolbar
- Feat: Add map tool for selecting and drawing the reshape geometry
- Feat: Support complex calculation for the common segment
- Feat: Add snapping support when drawing the reshape geometry

## [0.0.1] - 2022-10-28

- Initial release: API for finding common segments and making reshape edits
