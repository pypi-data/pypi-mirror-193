Characterization in time
==============================================

Presumably, you want to get some advanced knowledge about how your devices behave in time. That could be either on short timescales, much faster than measurements can complete, or on long timescales, much slower than you're willing to sit there.

Monitoring a value over time is pretty self explanatory. See :py:func:`~lightlab.util.characterize.monitorVariable`.

Strobe tests are much more interesting. Check out :py:func:`~lightlab.util.characterize.sweptStrobe` in here
