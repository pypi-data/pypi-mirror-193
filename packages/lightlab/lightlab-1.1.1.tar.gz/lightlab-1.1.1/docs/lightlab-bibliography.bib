@article{Tait:16multi,
	Abstract = {We demonstrate 4-channel, 2GHz weighted addition in a silicon microring filter bank. Accurate analog weight control becomes more difficult with increasing number of channels, N, as feedback approaches become impractical and brute force feedforward approaches take O(2N) calibration measurements in the presence of inter-channel dependence. We introduce model-based calibration techniques for thermal cross-talk and cross-gain saturation, which result in a scalable O(N) calibration routine and 3.8 bit feedforward weight accuracy on every channel. Practical calibration routines are indispensible for controlling large-scale microring systems. The effect of thermal model complexity on accuracy is discussed. Weighted addition based on silicon microrings can apply the strengths of photonic manufacturing, wideband information processing, and multiwavelength networks towards new paradigms of ultrafast analog distributed processing.},

@article{Tait:15,
	Abstract = {We consider an optical technique for performing tunable weighted addition using wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) inputs, the enabling function of a recently proposed photonic spike processing architecture. WDM weighted addition provides important advantages to performance, integrability, and networking capability that were not possible in any past approaches to optical neurocomputing. In this letter, we report a WDM weighted addition prototype used to find the first principal component of a 1Gbps, 8-channel signal. Wideband, multivariate techniques have immediate relevance to modern radio systems, and photonic spike processing networks enabled by WDM could open new domains of information processing that bring unprecedented bandwidth and intelligence to problems in radio communications, ultrafast control, and scientific computing.},
