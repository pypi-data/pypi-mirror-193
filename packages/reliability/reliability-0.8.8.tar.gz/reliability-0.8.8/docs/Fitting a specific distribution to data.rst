Fitting a specific distribution to data
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. admonition:: API Reference

   For inputs and outputs see the `API reference <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/Fitters.html>`_.

The module `reliability.Fitters` provides many probability distribution fitting functions as shown below.

Functions for fitting non-location shifted distributions:

-   Fit_Exponential_1P
-   Fit_Weibull_2P
-   Fit_Gamma_2P
-   Fit_Lognormal_2P
-   Fit_Loglogistic_2P
-   Fit_Normal_2P
-   Fit_Gumbel_2P
-   Fit_Beta_2P

Functions for fitting location shifted distributions:

-   Fit_Exponential_2P
-   Fit_Weibull_3P
-   Fit_Gamma_3P
-   Fit_Lognormal_3P
-   Fit_Loglogistic_3P

All of the distributions can be fitted to both complete and incomplete (right censored) data. All distributions in the Fitters module are named with their number of parameters (eg. Fit_Weibull_2P uses α,β, whereas Fit_Weibull_3P uses α,β,γ). This is intended to remove ambiguity about what distribution you are fitting.

Distributions are fitted simply by using the desired function and specifying the data as failures or right_censored data. You must have at least as many failures as there are distribution parameters or the fit would be under-constrained. It is generally advisable to have at least 4 data points as the accuracy of the fit is proportional to the amount of data. Once fitted, the results are assigned to an object and the fitted parameters can be accessed by name, as shown in the examples below. The goodness of fit criterions are also available as AICc (Akaike Information Criterion corrected), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), AD (Anderson-Darling), and loglik (log-likelihood), though these are more useful when comparing the fit of multiple distributions such as in the `Fit_Everything <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fitting%20all%20available%20distributions%20to%20data.html>`_ function. As a matter of convenience, each of the modules in Fitters also generates a distribution object that has the parameters of the fitted distribution.

The Beta distribution is only for data in the range 0 to 1. Specifying data outside of this range will cause an error. The fitted Beta distribution does not include confidence intervals.

If you have a very large amount of data (>100000 samples) then it is likely that your computer will take significant time to compute the results. This is a limitation of interpreted languages like Python compared to compiled languages like C++ which many commerial reliability software packages are written in. If you have very large volumes of data, you may want to consider using commercial software for faster computation time. The function Fit_Weibull_2P_grouped is designed to accept a dataframe which has multiple occurrences of some values (eg. multiple values all right censored to the same value when the test was ended). Depending on the size of the data set and the amount of grouping in your data, Fit_Weibull_2P_grouped may be much faster than Fit_Weibull_2P and achieve the same level of accuracy. This difference is not noticable if you have less than 10000 samples. For more information, see the example below on `using Fit_Weibull_2P_grouped <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fitting%20a%20specific%20distribution%20to%20data.html#using-fit-weibull-2p-grouped-for-large-data-sets>`_.

Heavily censored data (>99.9% censoring) may result in a failure of the optimizer to find a solution. If you have heavily censored data, you may have a limited failure population problem. It is recommended that you do not try fitting one of these standard distributions to such a dataset as your results (while they may have achieved a successful fit) will be a poor description of your overall population statistic and you risk drawing the wrong conclusions when the wrong model is fitted. The limited failure population model is planned for a future release of *reliability*, though development on this model is yet to commence. In the meantime, see JMP Pro's model for `Defective Subpopulations. <https://www.jmp.com/en_my/events/ondemand/statistical-methods-in-reliability/defective-subpopulation-distributions.html>`_

If you do not know which distribution you want to fit, then please see the `section <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fitting%20all%20available%20distributions%20to%20data.html>`_ on using the Fit_Everything function which will find the best distribution to describe your data. It is highly recommended that you always try to fit everything and accept the best fit rather than choosing a particular distribution for subjective reasons.

If you have tried fitting multiple distributions and nothing seems to work well, or you can see the scatter points on the probability plot have an S-shape or a bend, then you may have data from a mixture of sources. In this case consider fitting a `Mixture model <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Mixture%20models.html>`_ or a `Competing Risks Model <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Competing%20risk%20models.html>`_.

Example 1
---------

To learn how we can fit a distribution, we will start by using a simple example with 30 failure times. These times were generated from a Weibull distribution with α=50, β=3. Note that the output also provides the confidence intervals and standard error of the parameter estimates. The probability plot is generated be default (you will need to specify plt.show() to show it). See the section on `probability plotting <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Probability%20plots.html#what-does-a-probability-plot-show-me>`_ to learn how to interpret this plot.

The above probability plot is the typical way to visualise how the CDF (the blue line) models the failure data (the black points). If you would like to view the failure points alongside the PDF, CDF, SF, HF, or CHF without the axis being scaled then you can generate the scatter plot using the function plot_points which is available within reliability.Probability_plotting. In the example below we create some data, then fit a Weibull distribution to the data (ensuring we turn off the probability plot). From the fitted distribution object we plot the Survival Function (SF). We then use plot_points to generate a scatter plot of the plotting positions for the survival function.

.. admonition:: API Reference

   For inputs and outputs of the plot_points function see the `API reference <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/Probability_plotting/plot_points.html>`_.

This example shows how to use the plot_points function.

Example 3
---------

It is beneficial to see the effectiveness of the fitted distribution in comparison to the original distribution. In this example, we are creating 500 samples from a Weibull distribution and then we will right censor all of the data above our chosen threshold. Then we are fitting a Weibull_3P distribution to the data. Note that we need to specify "show_probability_plot=False, print_results=False" in the Fit_Weibull_3P to prevent the normal outputs of the fitting function from being displayed.

Example 4
---------

As another example, we will fit a Gamma_2P distribution to some partially right censored data. To provide a comparison of the fitting accuracy as the number of samples increases, we will do the same experiment with varying sample sizes. The results highlight that the accuracy of the fit is proportional to the amount of samples, so you should always try to obtain more data if possible.

Example 5
---------

To obtain details of the quantiles (y-values from the CDF) which include the lower estimate, point estimate, and upper estimate, we can use the quantiles input for each Fitter. In this example, we will create some data and fit a Weibull_2P distribution. When quantiles is specified the results printed includes both the table of results and the table of quantiles. Setting quantiles as True will use a default list of quantiles (as shown in the first output). Alternatively we can specify the exact quantiles to use (as shown in the second output). The use of the `crosshairs <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Crosshairs.html>`_ function is also shown which was used to annotate the plot manually. Note that the quantiles provided are the quantiles of the confidence bounds on time. You can extract the confidence bounds on on reliability using the fitted distribution object as shown `here <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Working%20with%20fitted%20distributions.html>`_.

Using Fit_Weibull_2P_grouped for large data sets
------------------------------------------------

The function Fit_Weibull_2P_grouped is effectively the same as Fit_Weibull_2P, except for a few small differences that make it more efficient at handling grouped data sets. Grouped data sets are typically found in very large data that may be heavily censored. The function includes a choice between two optimizers and a choice between two initial guess methods for the initial guess that is given to the optimizer. These help in cases where the data is very heavily censored (>99.9%). The defaults for these options are usually the best but you may want to try different options to see which one gives you the lowest log-likelihood.
