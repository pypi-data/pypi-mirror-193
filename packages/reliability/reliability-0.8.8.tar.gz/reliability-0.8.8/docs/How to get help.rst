How to get help
'''''''''''''''

**Questions on statistics or mathematics**

If you have a question about a statistical or mathematical process that ``reliability`` performs, please consult Google and Wikipedia to see if you can find an existing explaination. If you still need to ask someone then I recommend asking your question on `Stack Exchange <https://stats.stackexchange.com>`_. If you still can't get an answer on there, you're welcome to email me directly (alpha.reliability@gmail.com) and I will try my best to help you.

**Questions on using the Python reliability library**

If you have a question about how to do something using ``reliability`` or how to use one of the features within ``reliability`` then you should firstly consult the `documentation <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ and the help files within Python. An example of how to access one of the help files is provided below. If the documentation and help files still do not answer your question then you're welcome to email me directly (alpha.reliability@gmail.com) and I will work to improve the documentation if it is unclear.

.. code:: python

    from reliability import Fitters
    print(help(Fitters))
