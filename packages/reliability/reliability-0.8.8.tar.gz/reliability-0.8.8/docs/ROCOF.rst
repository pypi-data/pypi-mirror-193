ROCOF
'''''

Rate of occurrence of failures (ROCOF) is used to model the trend (constant, increasing, decreasing) in the failure interarrival times. For a repairable system, we want the ROCOF to be improving (failure interarrival times to be increasing). As failure times can often appear quite random, it is necessary to conduct a statistical test to determine if there is a statistically significant trend, and if there is a trend we can then model that trend using a Power Law NHPP. The test for statistical significance is the Laplace test which compares the Laplace test statistic (U) with the z value (z_crit) from the standard Normal Distribution. If there is a statistically significant trend, the parameters of the model (Lambda_hat and Beta_hat) are calculated. By default the results are printed and a plot of the failure interarrival times and MTBF is plotted.

.. admonition:: API Reference

   For inputs and outputs see the `API reference <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/Repairable_systems/ROCOF.html>`_.

In the example below, we provide the failure interarrival times. The function will run the Laplace test using the default 95% confidence interval and then, when a trend is found, it will plot the MTBF based on the calculated NHPP Power Law model. MTBF = 1/ROCOF. This example is based on Example 5.11 (p275) from Reliability Engineering and Risk analysis listed in the `recommended resources <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recommended%20resources.html>`_.
