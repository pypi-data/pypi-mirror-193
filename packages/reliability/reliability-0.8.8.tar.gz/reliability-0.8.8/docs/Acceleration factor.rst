Acceleration factor
'''''''''''''''''''

The Arrhenius model for Acceleration factor due to higher temperature is :math:`AF = exp\left[\frac{E_a}{K_B}\left(\frac{1}{T_{use}}-\frac{1}{T_{acc}}\right)\right]`
This function accepts T_use as a mandatory input and you may specify any two of the three other variables, and the third variable will be found.

.. admonition:: API Reference

   For inputs and outputs see the `API reference <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/PoF/acceleration_factor.html>`_.

In the example below, the acceleration factor is found for an accelerated test at 100째C for a component that is normally run at 60째C and has an activation energy of 1.2 eV.

.. code:: python

    from reliability.PoF import acceleration_factor
    acceleration_factor(T_use=60,T_acc=100,Ea=1.2)
