Fitting all available distributions to data
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. admonition:: API Reference

   For inputs and outputs see the `API reference <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/Fitters/Fit_Everything.html>`_.

To fit all of the `distributions available <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fitting%20a%20specific%20distribution%20to%20data.html>`_ in `reliability`, is a similar process to fitting a specific distribution. The user needs to specify the failures and any right censored data. The Beta distribution will only be fitted if you specify data that is in the range 0 to 1 and does not include confidence intervals on the plot. The selection of what can be fitted is all done automatically based on the data provided. Manual exclusion of probability distributions is also possible. If you only provide 2 failures then all distributions with more than 2 parameters will automatically be excluded from the fitting process.

Confidence intervals are shown on the plots but they are not reported for each of the fitted parameters as this would be a large number of outputs. If you need the confidence intervals for the fitted parameters you can repeat the fitting using just a specific distribution and the results will include the confidence intervals. Confidence intervals are not yet available for the Weibull DS, Weibull Mixture, and Weibull CR models.

The distributions Weibull_ZI and Weibull_DSZI are not included when using Fit_Everything as these distributions are only applicable when the dataset contains zeros. If your data contains zeros you should fit these distributions individually.

Example 1
---------

In this first example, we will use `Fit_Everything` on some data and will return only the dataframe of results. Note that we are actively supressing the 4 plots that would normally be shown to provide graphical goodness of fit indications. The table of results has been ranked by BIC to show us that Weibull_2P was the best fitting distribution for this dataset. This is what we expected since the data was generated using Weibull_Distribution(alpha=50,beta=2).

.. code:: python

    from reliability.Fitters import Fit_Everything
    # data created using Weibull_Distribution(alpha=50,beta=2), and rounded to nearest integer
    data = [92, 44, 94, 56, 54, 24, 96, 3, 27, 37, 61, 23, 70, 101, 21, 47, 4, 34, 10, 88, 37, 86, 62, 70, 21, 13, 47, 21, 57, 36, 43, 83, 42, 16, 20, 44, 43, 50, 35, 51, 35, 49, 60, 22, 34, 41, 53, 27, 44, 49]
