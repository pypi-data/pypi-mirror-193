# QSolve

QSolve provides numerical methods for the simulation of ultracold quantum gases
at zero and finite temperature.

## Requirements

* Operating System: Linux 64 Bit
* Hardware: Multicore CPU or GPU (CUDA)
* Python 3.9

## Development Configuration

* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)
* Hardware: Nvidia Quadro GV100 or NVIDIA Titan V

All numerical methods are implemented using double precision floating point operations (FP64).
Please note that FP64 performance on conventional GPUs is highly restricted 
in comparison with professional GPUs like the ones listed above.
