# C#-Style Event Handling Mechanism for Python

C# provides a very simple syntax using the observer pattern for its event handling system.
The aim of this project is to implement the pattern in python as similarly as possible.

In C#, an "event" is a field or a property of the delegate type `EventHandler`.
Since delegates in C# can be combined and removed with `+=` and `-=` operators,
event handlers can easily subscribe to or unsubscribe from the event using those operators.

Python does not support an addition of two `Callable` types.
So the `Event[P]` class is provided to mimic delegates:

```python
from cs_events import Event

on_change: Event[object, str] = Event()
```

Handlers can subscribe to and unsubscribe from the event with the same syntax:

```python
def event_handler(o: object, s: str) -> None:
    ...

on_change += event_handler
on_change -= event_handler
```

An event can be raised by simply invoking it with the arguments:

```python
on_change(self, "value")
```

Since `Event` acts just like a delegate from C#, it is not required to be bound to a class or an instance object.
This is the major difference to other packages that try to implement the C#-style event system, which usually revolve around a container object for events.

An example class with event fields may look like this:

```python
class EventExample:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.on_update: Event[str] = Event()
        self.__value = ""
    
    def update(self, value: str) -> None:
        if self.__value != value:
            self.__value = value
            self.on_update(value)

obj = EventExample()
obj.on_update += lambda value: print(f"obj.{value=}")
obj.update("new value")
```

A class decorator `@events` is provided as a shortcut for event fields and
properties:

```python
from cs_events import Event, events

@events
class EventFieldsExample:
    item_added: Event[object]
    item_removed: Event[object]
    item_updated: Event[object, str]

@events(properties=True)
class EventPropertiesExample:
    loaded: Event[int]
    disposed: Event[[]]

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._events = {}
```

Check the documentation of `@events` for more detail on event properties.

## Installation

pip install cs-events
```
