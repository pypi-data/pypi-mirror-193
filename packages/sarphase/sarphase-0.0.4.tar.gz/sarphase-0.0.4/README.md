# SARPhase

# Description

SAR Product Processing Library.

# Installation

The SARPhase package can be installed directly from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) running the pip command 
on the system shell:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Python 
>>> pip install sarphase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SARPhase package is based on Python 3.6. It is therefore recommended not to work  with lower python versions, 
as the correct functioning of the library is not guaranteed.</div>
