# What is SQLMesh?

SQLMesh is a next-generation SQL transformation platform. It provides you with powerful automation for versioning, backfilling, deployment, and testing &mdash; allowing you to focus on simply writing SQL.

SQLMesh is able to achieve all of this with minimal setup; there are no additional services or dependencies required to get started using SQLMesh other than a connection to your existing data warehouse or engine.
