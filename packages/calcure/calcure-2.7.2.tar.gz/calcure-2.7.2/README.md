## Installation

3. Install the program and libraries libraries by typing in the Windows Terminal `pip install windows-curses calcure`
4. Now you can finally run it by typing in the Windows Terminal `python -m calcure`

### Upgrade to the most recent version

`pip install --upgrade calcure`

## Dependencies

- python 3
- `holidays`, `jdatetime`, and 'ics' python libraries. Install by `pip install holidays jdatetime ics`.

## Usage

Run `calcure` in your terminal. You may need to restart your terminal after the install.

### Syncing with cloud calendars

Calcure can display in read-only mode events and tasks from Nextcloud, Google, and other calendars. See this [wiki page](https://github.com/anufrievroman/calcure/wiki/Syncing-.ics-files-from-clouds) for examples.

### User arguments

Calcure supports automations and can be started in special mods using various user arguments. Please refer [to this wiki page](https://github.com/anufrievroman/calcure/wiki/User-arguments) for the list of options.

### Key bindings

[List of all key bindings](https://github.com/anufrievroman/calcure/wiki/Key-bindings) can be accessed in the wiki and via `?` key in the program.

### Settings

On the first run, program will create a configuration file at `~/.config/calcure/config.ini`.
You can edit parameters, colors, and icons in the `config.ini` file.
An example of the [config.ini file is here](https://github.com/anufrievroman/calcure/wiki/Default-config.ini).
Explanations of all settings are [in the wiki](https://github.com/anufrievroman/calcure/wiki/Settings).

## Troubleshooting

- If your terminal shows empty squares instead of icons, probably it does not support unicode. In this case, in config set: `use_unicode_icons = No`.
- Weather widget slows down launch of the program and requires internet. If that is a problem, switch weather off in config: `show_weather = No`.
- If weather is incorrect, set your city in config `weather_city = Tokyo`. By default, this setting is empty and program tries to detect your city automatically from your ip.
- If after install the program does not run by just running `calcure`, try to restart your terminal, it may need to recheck the binaries.
- AUR package is autdated, please use `pip install calcure` for installation.

## Roadmap

- Support for .ics files in read only mode
- Support for .ics files in read and write mode
